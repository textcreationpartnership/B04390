            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>TRuth, though most Ancient, and in it selfe most plain; yet to the World Credulous of Error, blind, as to Truth, soon imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and long holding the one, soon forsaking, and easily offended at the other: It appears a meer <hi>Novelty,</hi> Acts 17.18.19.20. as those Waters seemed Blood to the <hi>Moabites eyes,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.22. Long Custome,<note place="margin">Cosuetado tempore cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborata pro lege habetur <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi>
               </note> and old Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, strengthened with the Wit and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Men, doth so farre prevaile, as to give credit and authority to Error, to be generally received for Truth; and the tenure, that most hold their practises in religion by, is not so much Scripture, the Rule and Guide of Conscience, as Custome and Example; so as Custome is oft turned into, and Pleaded for as Conscience. We should not wonder at the prejudices Men take at Truth; the greatest Professors of it, have sometimes been the greatest opposers, and most ignorant of it. Who Studied the <hi>Messias</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:178839:3"/> more in Prophesies, seemed more to long for <hi>his</hi> comming, then the Learned Scribes and Pharisees, with the High Priests and Rabbines? Yet when he comes, they despise him, see no forme nor beauty in him; account him a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver of the People; one possest with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; Hate him, Persecute him, Crucifie him, Imbrue their Hearts and Hands in his Blood: One would have thought, of all others, they had been most unlike to have acted that Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Certain <hi>Devout Persons,</hi> Acts 13.50. were the greatest Enemies to <hi>Paul:</hi> The greatest Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders formerly to Church-Discipline and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, were the greatest Enemies to it. Had holy <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> lived in our dayes, 'its possible they would have had as high thoughts of the wayes of the Churches of <hi>Christ,</hi> as any we can wish to our Godly Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Brethren. If God with-hold his Light from Shining out, the Brightest Starre in the Church will become darke; the highest Starre Shines but with a borrowed Light; and that should humble us, and make us thankfull, not to be exalted with any abundance of Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; If God hath made it <hi>Goshen</hi> with us in our understandings, be farre from insulting and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:178839:3"/> boasting over our fellow Brethren who differ from us. God denies discoveries of Truth often to very eminent Saints, for high and glorious ends best known to himselfe. Experience tells us, That to every Age God hath deseigned some distinguishing Truth, to try the Obedience, Love and Patience of his Saints, and for the world to stumble at. We are now upon the border of the most glorious times, for discovery of Truth, and for the pouring out of the Spirit: we had need have our Eyes about us, and be circumspect and watchfull against rejecting Truth, as well as imbracing Error; that Satan invents such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of Errors in these dayes, it argues some Truths are neer the birth, which he would deale withall, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> with the Hebrew Children, indeavouring to stifle them in the birth, many being so astonished and amused, that they sit down with what the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, fearing all beyond that to be Heresie; we should be equally as free to Truth, as fearefull of Error. To be hide-bound to Truth, is as bad, if not worse, than to be catching of Error. Let every Truth have its full value and place: He that accounts slightly of the least Truth, so farre he accounts little of Christ, and despises
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:178839:4"/> Christ: Its the humour of our Politicians to practise onely Popular and State-wayes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, courted by the multitude: as for others, they are indifferent, well if they contain from Persecution. They that goe with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, will sooner take up stones to throw at Truth, than Scriptures, to examine Truth by. The least Truth contains Christ in the bowels of it, and to a godly heart weighs more then the Earth. Every Truth is a beame of God, and when espoused to the Soule by the Spirit of God, it assimulates to God, and sanctifies and becomes the inscription of God drawn out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the soule. Look not what Truth is of most note in the World, but what is owned by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; what agrees not with it, <hi>omnibus numeris,</hi> is false and crooked. The Scripture is Gods Oracle, Truths Chaire of State; there we must consult her, and no where else. And how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely are we beholden to the mercy and grace of God, that when there is but one onely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule in all the world, God doth so farre condescend to our weakenesse, as to make it plain and easie in all practicall points. Lets exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all we refuse, and receive, with much selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniall, Prayer, conference, forbearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:178839:4"/> renouncing our own parts and wisedome, depending upon him, who is the Father of light, the Prime and Originall truth. I would not be understood, as Judging any who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary minded. I remember the whole streame of the practise of the godly, is generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst: with the greater humility therefore, I desire to declare my differing light, proposing to their examination, and enquirie all that shall be said. Whatsoever our differences be herein, let us still mind the maine, and keep within the Golden Rule; Remembring, that God hath called us unto Peace and Love, not to Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Bitternesse; and let every one be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded in all these things in his owne minde, and so let him walke, (not offending other Brethren in their practize) onely see that he fetch his Light from, and Ground his Practise upon the Word of God, which we must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as our Pillar of Fire, and Pillar of Cloud.</p>

            <p>THe Seventh day, Recorded in the fourth Commandement, hath been generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and reputed <hi>Jewish,</hi> and so buried
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:178839:5"/> amongst Ceremoniall Rites. To be ashamed or a scare of Truth, because of Nick-names, and the little repute it hath in the world, argues want of Love unto, or knowledge of Truth. The Scribes and Pharisees call Christ <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> to make people afraid to look at him, or owne him: It matters not by what Names or Titles men call things, but what Name soever God putteth upon any thing, that shall stand good, and every thing shall be called by its right and proper name at the last day. <hi>Truth</hi> is often suspected, because of odde Names put on it by the artifice of Satan, to hinder men from being inamoured with the lovelinesse and beauty of it; and oft Error goes so neatly drest and atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that though it have no naturall beauty of its own, it passes currant with those who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see so clearly into the nature of things. Its a time for us to weigh every thing at the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Sanctuary. Theres nothing so down weight, so plain and perspicuous, which the inventions of men cannot finde out many witty and probable objections against. If the seventh day be found to have the double appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and witnesse of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, its sufficient security for our subjection
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:178839:5"/> and obedience. Consider it in its first Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and thats as ancient almost as Man, and more ancient then sinne it selfe; for some hold, That <hi>Adam</hi> fell the first seventh day, on which also Christ was Promised. The first seventh day God himselfe kept, resting from all his work, and delighting himself in looking over all that he had made, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. &amp; 2.2.<note place="margin">Ains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth.</note> The Hebrew Root for seven, signifies <hi>fulnesse, perfection:</hi> and the Jews held many Mysteries to be in the number seven: So <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Apocalypse</hi> useth much that number: As, seven Churches, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Starres, seven Spirits, seven Candlesticks, seven Angels, seven Seales, seven Trumpets: and we no sooner meet with a seventh day, but its blessed; no sooner with a seventh man, <hi>Enoch,</hi> but he is Traslated. The Sabbath was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in his State of Innocency, long before the Institution of the Jewish Church, and so was Moral, given to all Nations, as other Lawes engraven on mans heart by God himselfe; not Cerimoniall onely, as some would have it; it was founded in Paradise it selfe, and so stands exempt from the number of those Figures and Types that were to dye and expire with the Death of Christ; for whatever
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:178839:6"/> was simply Jewish and Typicall, then received its desolution from his satisfying Crosse. This seventh was observed by all the holy Patriarkes before the Law: And God himselfe observed it when he rained Manna, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.12. he keeps to his own Institution. When he comes to In act, and make it into a Law, among other Morall and perpetuall Statutes and Ordinances, he praefaceth more especially before it, and puts a solemne Memento upon it, to show how cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious he is, and would have us to be of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day. We should remember how God kept it, how the Saints in Heaven keep their Sabbath, and doe like them in Prayses, Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, Admiring the Eternall love of Christ, and of God, who both of them Rested from their Work on the seventh day. <hi>Remember to keep holy the seventh day.</hi> A speciall frame of holinesse, should be then upon our Hearts, more then ordinary, which we should labour to keep and weare all the six dayes after. And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is very positive <hi>for the seventh day,</hi> take away the day, and the Morallity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand seems to be destroyed. God saith not, Keep holy a seventh day, but <hi>the seventh day;</hi> as if he would have no other day but <hi>that.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:178839:6"/> What is there more Jewish in that, then in the second, fifth, or tenth Commandements. We shall finde it <hi>Isay</hi> 58.13. &amp; 56.1.2.4.6. <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> 20.12.16.21.24. &amp; 22.8.9. placed among those things that are not Legall Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, but of perpetuall universall observance among the Saints and People of God, in all Ages and Places; God intending that this should out-live the lump of Ceremonies. It stands placed in the middle of the Decalogue, as that which hath aspect both wayes; To our duties to Man, and to God, a common tye and ligament between both Tables. God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to keep day and time with us; and its but just, that we should remember to <hi>keep</hi> his day. Those two Tables were the Writing of the Finger of God himselfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.18. &amp; 32.15.16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.10. and contained nothing Ceremoniall, but what is Morall and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the Letter of it. First God practises it; and then he Writes it as a Law. And when God comes to make the New Covenant (the Covenant is the same alwayes, onely made in a New manner in Christ the Mediator) he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to Write his Laws in our Hearts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. even the same that he Writ with his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:178839:7"/> Writing, argues the subjecting of the soul to him, transcribing them upon the soule, and thereby transforming the soule unto the holy nature of the Law. And of this Law, written with the Finger of God in two Tables, speaks Christ, <hi>That not one title of it shall passe away, untill all be fulfilled,</hi> Mat. 5.18. Luke 16.17. Christ fulfilled, but never abolished this Law. The hand-writing of Ordinances that was to be blotted out, and was contrary unto us, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. is not meant of the Morall Law, in its Morall Observation, but of the Ceremoniall Law, or of the Law as a Covenant of Works, that had a curse annexed unto the not doing of it, which no flesh was able to doe and performe, but Christ onely, our surety; his blood hath blotted it out, that we have nothing to doe with it, nor it with us. And in that sence Christ dyed to take away the Law; so as we may say with <hi>Luther, Lex nostra Christus est.</hi> VVe should <hi>know</hi> no Law, no command, but Christ. <hi>Lex Diabolus est in Conscienscia,</hi> where it is praedominant in the Conscience. Its <hi>Agar,</hi> the Bond-woman, which is to be cast out, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite unto the Promise and Covenant of grace in Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.23.24. Though the Law must
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:178839:7"/> not be a Saints Principle, yet it must guide his practise. The Morall Law is called, <hi>The Tables of the Covenant,</hi> Heb. 9.4. which were in the <hi>Arke,</hi> a <hi>Type</hi> of Christ. In the <hi>Arke</hi> was the <hi>Mannah, Aarons Rod</hi> that Budded, the <hi>Tables</hi> of the <hi>Covenant:</hi> nothing but what is perpetuall was in the <hi>Arke,</hi> those signifying (as some think) the Sacraments, the Ministery, the Moral Law. After our being in Christ, we are more bound to keep the Law, then before: Grace is a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Law, as its a beame of the holy nature of God. The strength of sinne that lay in the Law, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. is taken away by the sight of pardon, and satisfaction through Christ; and so the Law becomes as a dead Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and we dead to it (that hath no more power over us, as to Guilt, or Obedience) when once we are Married to <hi>Christ,</hi> our second Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, by vertue of which Marriage, we bring forth all the fruits of our acceptable Obedience to God; and no other Obedience he owns, but what springs from that match, or union, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.1. <hi>to the</hi> 5. <hi>The Law</hi> then, as to our practise, was alwayes Morall, even in Paradise it selfe; and what was once Morall, cannot be made afterward Typicall. What more Jewishnesse,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:178839:8"/> or Typicalnesse, in the fourth Commandement, then in the second, <hi>Thou shalt make thee no Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Image.</hi> The Papists, in oppositions to the Jews, fill all their Churches and Temples with Pictures and Images, falling down before them, and worshipping, as they say, God in them, or by them, to the just scandall of the Jews, and hardening them against the Christian Doctrine. Circumcision was Typicall, signifying <hi>Christ</hi> to come, and to dye, and be cut off in our flesh; and was properly called, <hi>A yoke,</hi> by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles themselves, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. and the Urgers of it charged with subvertion of the <hi>Soules</hi> of the Disciples, <hi>Verse</hi> 24. saying, <hi>They must be Circumcised, and keep the Law, unto whom we gave no such command.</hi> The Law there, is to be understood of the whole Ceremoniall Law, to the keeping whereof, Circumcision bound then, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. But for the Morall Law, <hi>James,</hi> one of the Principall composers of that Letter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely charges the observation of it upon all Christians, <hi>James</hi> 1.25. &amp; 2.8.9.10.11. and he calls it, <hi>The Royall Law, The Law of Liberty.</hi> For Obedience and Holinesse is the greatest badge of a Christians Honour and Liberty. None is so free as he that lives most by Rule;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:178839:8"/> none so Noble as he that is most subject to the Law of God. But what charge was there ever brought by any Apostle against the Sabbath, for being a <hi>yoke,</hi> which is given to us for a day of spirituall delights, to be spent in holy rest, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, ordinances, and all good works? what more <hi>yoke,</hi> or Jewishnesse in the rest of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, then of the first? If the Day was Typicall, the rest was Typicall also; and both did end in <hi>Christ,</hi> as some say, who was Gods rest, and ours too; and so we should have no day of holy rest. A man may be Jewish in imposing too much upon the bare <hi>Letter,</hi> or out-side of an Ordinance, but cannot be too strict in the spirituall disposition, and bent of his heart in it. Men disclaime the seventh day as Jewish, against which, no Apostle spoke or writ; and yet they will make use of the <hi>Jewish Circumcision</hi> to prove Infant Baptisme by, which no Apostle made use of ever to that purpose, but witnessed against it, as wholly abbrogated, and subverting mens soules. In the Old Testament then, the seventh day stands without contradiction Gods holy and blessed day, sanctified, and set a part for a day of rest and holy meditation, and as a remembrance, earnest, and pledge of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

               <hi>Christ</hi> destroyes not the Letter of the Law, but confirmes it: And that he shews, by putting a more spirituall and holy sence upon the Text of the Law, then the Scribes and Pharisees ever did, or could; who onely rested in the bare Letter, or Literall sence of the Law. The Gospel puts a more spirituall Interpretation upon the fourth Commandement, and injoynes a more holy and spirituall kind of Rest, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the strength it gives, and so we

A Church they were before the death of <hi>Christ. Christ</hi> was the first Officer. The Apostles the first Members. For they were all Baptized, and received all the Lords Supper, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed all Acts of Communion before <hi>Christs</hi> Death. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4. we reade that the Apostles were Assembled together, or Eating together, (that was one speciall act of Communion in those dayes, <hi>Eating together, Acts</hi> 2.46. to which also was commonly annexed Prayer and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation one of another) and <hi>Christ</hi> Personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them. And it was the last meeting that he had with them, he went to Heaven from that meeting, and it was a Church meeting too, (to shew, that he could finde in his heart to live and dye amongst the Saints; if he would be in any place upon Earth, he would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them in the Church, as the next best to Heaven; he hath no other Heaven upon Earth) he goes not to Heaven from the Temple (he never owns that, never appears there, after his Resurrection, to shew the Abrogation of all Temple-worship, and service) but from among
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:178839:13"/> his Disciples and Saints, met together in acts of holy Communion. Oh what enemies to Christ were those Bishops, Minister, Magistrates, that would rob Christ of his delight in this world, hinder and persecute the meeting of Saints, jeering at their acts of mutuall love and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship. How hath Christ met with them to purpose both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the yokes of such men from off the Saints neckes? Againe, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.13.14. we reade of another Church meeting, after <hi>Christs</hi> Assenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (the day the Holy Ghost hath concealed from us, as he hath done the day of his Birth; which if we had known, we might have done with it, as the Jewes with the Body of <hi>Moses,</hi> had they known where it layd: God never giving any command, in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, concerning any day but one; and would have us know no other,) after they had seen him taken up in such Glory, (even as he shall also come again, to set up his Kingdom in the World, <hi>verse</hi> 11.) they got together, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued together in Prayer and Supplication, <hi>verse</hi> 13.14.

And also in the same Chapter, we Reade of another <hi>Church-meeting,</hi> in the 15. <hi>verse,</hi> about the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a new Apostle, and that with Prayer also. Of all those severall <hi>Church-meetings,</hi> we doe not Reade any mention made of the day on which they were. But as we were speaking, the day of Pentecost, in the second Chapter, (the first Sabbath we meet with in this book) was the day of the first Publique <hi>Church-meeting,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:178839:14"/> of that first Mother Christian Church, (which continued a pure Virgin 66. yeares, before shee degenerated, and had about 16. Bishops, all Jewes, succeeding one another, <hi>Euseb.</hi>) wherein, the Preaching of the Word, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, were Publiquely Administred, <hi>verse</hi> 41. and that this day of Pentecost was the seventh day, is plain from <hi>Leviticus</hi> 23.15.16. the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath there mentioned is the day of Passeover, (the same day that <hi>Christ</hi> Celebrated the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over with his Disciples, <hi>Marke</hi> 14.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.7. instituted the <hi>Supper,</hi> was <hi>betrayed,</hi> which was the fifth day of the Week) a great Feast of the Jewes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.2. Now they were to count from the morrow after that Sabbath or Feast, (that is, from the next day, which was the sixth day of the Week, on which <hi>Christ</hi> suffered fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes they were to account, and the fiftieth day, would fall upon the Sabbath, or seventh day, the morrow after the Sabbath being to be counted the first of the fifty. So they kept the same Pentecost, with the Jews.</p>
            <p>Thus the Apostles practised, and if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the seventh day had not continued in force, they would have mentioned the repeale thereof, and layd a prohibition upon the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:178839:15"/> as to the further observation of it. For that notion of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> seems to be harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous to Truth, That all Laws meerly Jewish, were before <hi>Christs</hi> death <hi>Vivae,</hi> at his death <hi>Mortinae,</hi> after his death <hi>Mortiferae;</hi> than that great Jewish Ordinance of all, Circumcision, was discharged, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2.3. <hi>If ye be Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Christ shall profit you nothing.

What new day of Gods appointment, doth the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hold forth unto us, to be wholly observed as a Sabbath of rest?

               <hi>John</hi> 20. made a ground of Institution for the first day. <hi>John</hi> 21.14. its said, <hi>This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himselfe to his Disciples;</hi> and if it were the first day of the <hi>Weeke,</hi> they had not yet learned to keep it for a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> for they were then fishing at the Sea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> verse 1. he appears to them in their very Calling, shewing, that he blesses, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies our lawfull Callings and Labours, and that we should expect the presence of <hi>Christ</hi> in them, and so carry in them, that they may become Ordinances of conversing with Christ; and we are never right in them, but then: he teaches not his Disciples to give over their fishing Trade, but gives them his presence in it. Its the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Christ, to be Diligent, Holy, Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Calling. We are not to throw away our Callings, as some Monkes, Fryars, and others doe. I remember a Story, I take it is of S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Anthony;</hi> he lived an Hermite in a Wood, devoted to Prayer and Meditation; of which being proud, an Angel appeared, bids him to goe to such a Towne, and he should find a Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler a farre more holy man than he.

               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:178839:20"/> working and breathing out Heaven, such a tincture of glory upon his heart, so excellent in Prayer and Conference, that he returned asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of himselfe, and ever after more low in his owne eyes.

Laying it at the Apostles Feet implies a more secret and private way of gift. So here, <hi>Lay by him in store,</hi> &amp;c. It seems not probable that they did use so publiquely to make their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, being that some Heathen Persecutor might come in and observe them, and by their freenesse and bounty, have taken an Estimate of their Estates, and brought danger and incoveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon them.

But that this first day here implies a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and Collections to be made than and there in the <hi>Church,</hi> at the Supper, (this being onely an occasionall Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not constant) I see not. <hi>Paul</hi> telling us how <hi>Christ</hi> Institutes the Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23.24.25.26. prescribes nothing as to any Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, either at, or after the Supper.

In this matter I would not much contend, knowing much may be said to prove, that matters of order and convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie lie in the <hi>Churches</hi> Power: But its safest in every punctilio, to keep strictly to the cleare Rules of Scripture.

It was a very Ancient, and almost one of the first Controversies that we reade of in History. <hi>Fox</hi> Acts and Monuments, <hi>fol.</hi> 48. tells us, how <hi>Easter Day,</hi> was anciently kept upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or seventh Day. But one <hi>Hermes,</hi> reputed to be <hi>Pauls</hi> Disciple, having had a revelation, That it was to be kept on the <hi>Sunday;</hi> (so the Heathens called it, <hi>Dies Solis.

And <hi>fol.</hi> 111. he relates a very hot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, that was between one <hi>Wilfride</hi> a Bishop, and one <hi>Coleman</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> before <hi>Oswie</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> then present at that dispute, which was about the observation

Socrates, Schol. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. plainly affirmes, That all the ancient Christians kept their <hi>Easter Die Sabbathi;</hi> and that all the People through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, doe receive the holy Mysteries every <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> except the People of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> they on the <hi>Sunday.</hi> The <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> (it seems) was generally observed by the <hi>Greeke Churches; Sunday</hi> by the <hi>Latine.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:178839:29"/>
               <hi>Dies Sabbathi,</hi> after the Christians: The same likewise doth our Parliament records. <hi>Socrates</hi> saith, that some observed both dayes.

For what Apostle, or Evangelist
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:178839:30"/> ever made the fourth Commandement, or the seventh day, which was before the Law, to be partly Morall, partly Ceremoniall; or can any such distinction, or any thing that beares any tendency to make it Ceremoniall, be found in all their Writings? Or where was the <hi>Dominica</hi> once mentioned in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, or Records of Writers most ancient? unlesse those who are suspected justly, and into which many things have been foisted by the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, who have so bemudded the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of purer Antiquity, that little cleare, or sincere, doth runne downe unto us; onely the holy Scriptures, Gods own Records (of Love and Mercy in the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Christ</hi> for us) he hath taken care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve undefloured, untouched from the violation of men. These onely we must sticke and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to, therein God hath sufficiently instructed us what will please him in his own Worship, without being beholden to mans invention to modell new things, or raking in the puddle of humane Writers; and in all points of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence whatsoever, we must keep men punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the Scriptures, and question what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they can shew us from thence.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:178839:31"/> the Pope, Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Ape, hath turned into extreme Unction, and a Sacrament. I have heard of some godly, who have known it pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised upon some sicke with a blessing, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the party. <hi>Trapp. Com. Rom.</hi> 16.16. quotes Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> saying, the Independents at <hi>Arnhein</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> propounded this Kisse of Love to be practised among them, and annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Oyle, and singing Hymnes by one; blaming the holy endeavours of those Saints, to revive those Ordinances in their practise. So Psalmes, Hymnes, spirituall Songs, they were in the Primitive <hi>Churches, Gifts</hi> of the Spirit; as Prayer and Interpretation were, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. a Psalme is mentioned, as performed onely by one, as Doctrine, Revelation, Interpretation was, there must be edification in it, and so it must be a gift. That they had Translated Psalmes, and one Reading, and than all the rest of the <hi>Church</hi> to sing, will be somewhat diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to prove; and that they ought to prove, who would impose any set forme of Psalmes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, as an Ordinance of <hi>J. C. Colos.</hi> 3.16. they should be so richly fraught with the Word of God, it should inhabite in them in such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Wisedome, that they should be able to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:178839:32"/> teach and admonish one another every way; yea, so as to be able to translate any word of God into an Hymne, a Psalme, or Spirituall Song, in their hearts first, and than pronounce it, from the power of that inditement. Gifts I say, they were either publiquely exercised, as in that place; or in a more private way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.19. (they should be so filled with the Spirit, as to speake all in Psalmes, and Hymnes, and Spirituall Songs, (praising straines) not Songs in verse, but such as are the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate inditeting of the Spirit in the Soule, tuned by <hi>Christ.</hi> And that way of singing Psalmes in the heart, every Saint in some measure hath the skill of,) <hi>James</hi> 5.13. (as affliction is to ease it selfe by Prayer, so those holy ebullitions of Heavenly spirituall mirth, are to burst out into Psalmes. Psalmes imply an inward frame of prayses in the heart, and a sutable expression in words by way of a gift, to beget the same praysing frames in the hearts of others. Hearts of Saints are quires of prayses; full of bublings up, and enditings of Heavenly Modulations, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.1. which makes them like little Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens) but which way soever used, whether in the Church, or alone; spirituall Gifts they were,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:178839:32"/> not read Psalmes, musically sung, as in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church,</hi> or Poetically Translated into Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as among us Protestants, invented to supply the defect of that gift of spirituall Songs, as formerly the Liturgie, or Book of Common Prayer was brought in, to supply the defect of a gift of Prayer. Psalmes are spirituall and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly rejoycings, conceived in the soule by the holy Ghost, and exspressed by speaking, as <hi>Luke</hi> 1.42.46.47. &amp; <hi>cap.</hi> 2.13.14. they did not sing in any Poeticall way. Those ancient Psalmes and Hymnes of the O. &amp; N. Testament, were the immediate breathings of raised inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Soules, filled and transported with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirings of <hi>Christ,</hi> and rejoycings in him; as of holy <hi>Mary, Elizabeth, Zacharias, Simeon:</hi> so <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> being merry, and rejoycing in the Lord with chaines on their heeles, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.25. they <hi>prayed,</hi> and sung; as they <hi>prayed,</hi> so they sung, (by a gift of the Spirit) not set Formes, not Reading, either of the <hi>Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> or <hi>Davids Psalmes,</hi> that was too much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the gift of the Apostolicall times. Some were wont formerly to say, <hi>Is not the Lords Prayer better then any of our own making; can any Prayer goe beyond that?</hi> We never Reade that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:178839:33"/> ever <hi>Christ</hi> or the Apostles used it; onely he shewes the manner of Prayer, much heart, few words. Long Prayers have, for the most part, great hypocrisie, especially before others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the soule be under some strong gales of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall assistance, as oft a Saint will finde he cannot give over, he cannot get away from <hi>Christ,</hi> he is so well heard; and when he is gone, he longs to be at it again. <hi>Christ</hi> puts words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our mouthes, to shew, he loves Prayer, and will as certainly grant it, as he hath bid us Pray; but bids us not to Pray the very Words. I doe not beleeve that ever the holy Ghost did Pen the Book of <hi>Psalmes,</hi> or <hi>Solomons Song</hi> of <hi>Songs,</hi> or <hi>Christs Prayer,</hi> Mat. 6. besides many other <hi>Songs</hi> and <hi>Prayers,</hi> to be set Formes, for than we should never use any other <hi>Prayer,</hi> or <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> they being absolutely the best, better than any man breathing can make; they are not set us as formes, but as Rules, and Coppies for all our holy breathings. What edification, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, doth such singing afford, which the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Text in Scripture (which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Ordinance of God) doth not afford better and richer. <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> edified one another <hi>by</hi> their songs, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. <hi>they</hi> did not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:178839:33"/> sing the same song, neither did <hi>they</hi> sing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they were Songs indited in the Heart, from the present sence of mercy. We may make Ordinances to our selves, (as oft we doe spirituall injoyments, forme glorious Images, and Idaeaes of things in our fancies, and set up apprehensions of <hi>Christ</hi> in our own hearts) and thinke them to be reall. No warrant will be found in the Gospel, for set composed Psalmes, more then for set composed Prayer; for singing in Meeter, more then for Musicke, which was used in the Temple, and under the Law. The first Song we Reade of, was <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 15. and that was with Musicke, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. In the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there were singers on purpose imployed Night and day, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.53, &amp; 15.16. they had their Instruments also appointed, <hi>ver.</hi> 19.20.21. and Robes of fine Linnen, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.12.13. Many of these Titles of Psalmes are directed to Masters of Musicke: some Psalmes are Prayers, so <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.19. That singing was peculiar to the Levites, the very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments they played upon, appointed of God. There was a cleare Institution, both for the one and the other, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.25. and those singers had civill priviledges, as the Levites had,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:178839:34"/>
               <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.70. &amp; 7.24. Now grant we did come neerer to the first Institution of singing (though they sang the Text it selfe, we the Poeticall sence, which is not to be judged equall with the Text; so that neither did they sing as we doe, nor we sing as they did) yet unlesse such Musicall and Poeticall singing were confirmed in the New Testament, by praecept or practise, it could not hould. For what was practised in the Old Testament, not confirmed in the New, (as the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is) is to be accompted Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. Shew any such Musicall singing, either in the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or any <hi>Church</hi> Planted by the Apostles, in their dayes, wherein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was practized, but what was the exercise of a spirituall gift: If there was Reading, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding did follow, (as in <hi>Christs</hi> example, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.17. to the 23. and in <hi>Pauls, Acts</hi> 13.15.16.) if a Psalme, it was performed by one, as an admonishing gift, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. True! Musicall singing is very ancient, though in Ryme not so, (as the Latine Meeter in the Masse-booke shewes.) In imitation of that Temple-singing, both <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> used Musicke in their Churches; and it hath cost the pens of Learned men some sweat,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:178839:34"/> to defend the use of Organs, now exploded. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Confession, complaines, That when his heart was not so holily Tuned, yet his affections were tickled and moved, <hi>Flebam uber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim√® in Hymnis</hi> &amp; <hi>Canticis suav√® sonantis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae vocibus vehementer affectus,</hi> the loudnesse of Voyces, varietie of Notes, takes mens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. The ancient Christians had their <hi>Hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos Antelucanos.</hi> Antichrist got in very early into the Church with his Liturgie; and they talke of Saint <hi>James</hi> his Liturgie. <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaks of the ancient forme of singing: And <hi>Ignatius</hi> a Disciple of the Apostles, as they tell us, heard Angels singing Hynes to the holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which he brought in to the Church at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch;</hi> corrupt customes are soon introduced, and hold long. The Papists alledge for their practise of Singing and Musicke, the singing of Angels and Saints in Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.2. those blessed Spirits that live in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of God, need no Voyces, they sing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sound of words, they are, as we may say, all Tongue, all Sight, all Eares, &amp;c. they have no sences, but what are swallowed up in Glory; they see all in God, and nothing but God; and God is all to them. When <hi>Paul</hi> was a while in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:178839:35"/>
               <hi>Paradise,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. he heard works unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; he calls them words, because we know things onely by words; they in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>words,</hi> but <hi>unspeakeable,</hi> he could not repeat them, they were too big for his expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he lost his tongue, when he did but thinke of them: Scripture uses to ascribe Words, Trumpets, Harps, to the blessed Spirits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to signifie their glorious praysing, tryum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing state, in which they are in Heaven, or in <hi>Paradise;</hi> and those praising frames that the Saints carry in their bosomes, in the cleare sights and assured hopes of glory, hould the neerest Analogie with the Hymnes of <hi>Paradise.</hi> It is not the singing, but the matter and heart, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely mixt together, that makes a Hymne. I know not what Hymnes are, if those be not, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.1.5.6. which compared with <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. will evince that singing and saying, comes all to one thing. But that there is Song or Musicke in Heaven, we have no warrant to thinke, if one of these Hymnes were but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by those blessed Spirits, (all turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to praises, and full of all varietie of them) it would incomparably exceed all Song and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke whatsoever. In the Kingdome of <hi>Christ,</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:178839:35"/> the Saints shall utter praises, that would drown all Musicall Notes, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.10.11.12. What way of singing soever we maintain, whether the old Cathedrall way, or the late <hi>Geneva</hi> way, (for Psalmes was first Translated into Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by learned godly <hi>Beza,</hi> and others; the like by other Protestant Churches; and by us in <hi>England,</hi> and so joyned to the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Prayer,</hi> and are still practised very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly among some before their Battells, and otherwise ordinarily) it must be proved that that very way of singing, <hi>Modo</hi> &amp; <hi>Forma, (Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids Psalmes,</hi> or <hi>Solomons Song,</hi> and those Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated into Meeter, and first Read, and then Sung in Musicall Tunes, and then all singing together) is an Ordinance of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, commanded and practised by Christ and the Apostles, or it will fall into the number of humane Inventions. As for that Hymne after the Passeover and Supper, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.30. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it to be a Thanksgiving, composed and pronounced by Christ; now rejoycing in Spirit, praising the Father, being gladded in his heart for the blessed Institution of his Supper, (the remembrance of his love to us) and now having in his soule, the sence of all
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:178839:36"/> those blessed comforts that all the Saints should enjoy in that Ordinance afterwards; rejoycing also, that the time of his Death drew neere, when he was to manifest the highest testimony of his love to us in his blood and passion; in which Cup also, he had the sence of al the sorrows and bitternesses that ever any Saint was to tast of, and sweetned them. If it were a Psalme of <hi>Davids</hi> (as some conjecture that it was, the 105 Psalme, which the <hi>Jewes</hi> call the <hi>Great Hymne,</hi> and was wont to be sung by them at the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over) than it was onely an Appendix of the <hi>Jewish Passeover;</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> delivering the whole intire Institution of the Supper, in as ample manner as he received it of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 23. he doth not so much as mention the <hi>Hymne,</hi> but leaves it quite out. I mightily transgresse my intended brevtiy. This I freely professe, I am not scandalized at those that see this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of singing, an Ordinance of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, though I cannot; neither ought it to make the least breach in Love or Communion.

Let Sun, Moone, Starrs, Trees, Mountains, Rivers, &amp;c. be as so many plain Sermons of God. How can one look upon these, and not heare them Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some Attribute of an infinite God. One saying, Behold a good God, God in me. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Behold a wise and powerfull God in me. Another, Behold a living God in me.

Its an injury done to the Creature, to see it, and looke upon it, and not see God in it. Thou losest the good and comfort of that Creature, that thou doth not behold the Art and Hand of the Maker in. So Meditate upon all Gods works, as to raise Meditation to a breaking out into an holy Triumphing in God and his Works, from a sight and sence of our Interest, Propriety in him, as to be able to say, <hi>All these are Gods, and that God is mine,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21.22.23.

What won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull appearings for us against our Enemies, in such a heape of Victories, (both by Land, and now lately by Sea, most remarkeable, therein giving us new earnests of continued protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to the amazement of all the Nations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us? We should not lose a thread of any Providence, but gather them all together, and <hi>make</hi> Triumphs of them, and compose Songs to teach our Children. This we are taught in the 92. <hi>Psalme, ver.</hi> 4.5. a Psalme Penned on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, which consists of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Gods <hi>kindnesse, faithfulnesse</hi> in his diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent dealings in this World with the <hi>godly,</hi> and <hi>wicked,</hi> in such admirable straines of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, (and we of this Generation have seen as

That is it we must pray for, a <hi>worke</hi> within, to answer the glorious <hi>worke</hi> of God among us without, that must set the Crowne upon all our, conquests and successes. He that sees not <hi>Christ</hi> within conquering his lusts with the scepter of his power, will never magnifie and blesse him for his conquests in the world. Its sad, to see carnality, formality, praejudices, and want of Love, creeping in upon the spirits of all sorts of men. <hi>Christ</hi> doth expect to reape other fruit, and we may expect that he will make good his promises, in powring out of the spirit upon all sorts. We shall see a day shortly of <hi>Christs</hi> making way to his glorious Kingdome through the spirits of men, more than we have seen of it in the bloods of men.

How sweet our retirement to Heaven, and all those prepared Mansions of glory, (<hi>John</hi> 14.2.) after our wearisome abode upon Earth, as a place full of the habitations of cruelty and oppression, <hi>Psal.</hi> 74.20? It may be God will not have us to dye Rich and Honourable in the world; but he would have us dye Holy, Rich in good <hi>Workes,</hi> full of the fruits of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the first fruits of Eternity, and so goe to Heaven Praysing, and in all the Triumphs of Faith. Death cannot look unfriendly gastlily upon him, who hath lived in continuall famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:178839:54"/> with God, under the dayly appearings of a God, and streamings out of the blood of <hi>Christ</hi> upon his Conscience, to the washing thereof. We should hasten to get to our full stature in Christ, and be ever in a posture for Heaven, (there being but one step between us and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) so will death be made a holy desireable Ordinance of rest and communion with God. So it was to <hi>Christ, Luke</hi> 12.50. he was pained with his Love, to dye for us. His Death was as a Baptisme; he had such a desire as Saints have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any Ordinance. We shall finde it far better to be with <hi>Christ,</hi> then to be among the best Saints in the best Ordinances, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. yet, how much Heaven in the communion of Saints, nay oft in the society of one poore Saint in conference and prayer? The face of a Saint (whatsoever Judgement he be of) is lovely and delightfull. he speaks the Language of Paradise, he hath within in his soule an Eccho of Heaven, in his heart the habitation of God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.17. What blessed Ordinances are those (as also clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sett Communions) of which our hearts are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to say, as <hi>Peter</hi> upon the <hi>Mount, Let us build Tabernacles here, it is good for us to be here.</hi> Theres a glorious generall <hi>Sabbath</hi> comming,

            <p>A Word more to that consideration (the constant Practise of all Churches for so many Ages) which hath no small prevalency upon the Consciences of men. For the first two or three hundred years after Christ, Infant Baptisme, and the first day Sabbath, will be hardly found, either in the Opinion or Practise of those purer Times. Writers are oft brought in, speaking on all sides. We must onely heare Christ, (the great Prophet of the Church) and the Apostles, and nothing else must have influence upon our Conscience. It will not be demanded of us at the last day, whether we held and beleeved, as the Church beleeved; but what warrant we had from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to guide our Consciences. The Church is the Spouse of Christ, must be in subjection to her Head and Lord; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Scriptures Supremacy and infallibility onely. The consideration of the practise of Churches generally, should impose a holy feare and suspition upon our hearts, and cause great circumspection and watchfulnesse, and to see that which we professe against, be overcome with the mighty cleerenesse and brightnesse of Scripture, shining in upon Conscience. What is Catholicke (generally, constantly practized) hath a great force of binding Consciences. The world knows this by experience. For how long a tract of time did a read Liturgy, Lordly Episcopacy, &amp;c. continue in the Church? and the very name of Antiquity, Universality, &amp;c. begets a naturall reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Consciences of men not perfectly subjugated to the Authority of Scriptures, which onely must, and can satisfie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in all its scruples; and besides that blessed umpire, there is nothing can lay any just claime to infallibility, no not the Canons and Constitutions (suppose) of Angels. Matters of long usage, may be allowed their Honourable Sepultures, as the the Temple and <hi>Jewish</hi> Ceremonies had after Christs Death, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.17. but once the word of God discover things to my Conscience, not comprized within the rule of Faith, I cannot
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:178839:58"/> than allow them a moment longer intertainment there. Yet must all the Methods of the Gospel be observed in laying them downe, having all respect to peace and edification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.19. not to be over-zealous for a Truth, so as to despise another Brother dissenting, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.10. so charitably to walke, (not grieving, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending a Brother) as my good may not be evill spoken of, <hi>ver.</hi> 15.16.22. preferring alwayes holinesse and peace, and the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of my neighbour, before any Opinion, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.2.

That is onely made Truth to me, or thee, which we take out of the very ballance of Scripture, after weighing, Praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Be true to every practise, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve order and time, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.23. <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.2. View every Truth as it lyes in Scripture, and follow it with the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it was writ with at first; being as zealously affected to Love, as to Truth. And though we cannot look for any absolute Unity and Perfection among Saints, in this present state of weaknesse; yet, I think, we may safely affirme, that it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (since the will of Christ is so) to be in a Church of Saints the weakest, and most labouring with infirmities, (for the exercise of Love, and forbearance one towards another, wherein is more obedience and selfe-deniall, than in the strictest exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Duties and Gifts, wherein may be much hypocrisie) than to converse visibly with Angels and Spirits of just men made perfect.
